Hashing is a technique used in data structures that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access.

1. Hashing involves mapping data to a specific index in a hash table (an array of items) using a hash function. It enables fast retrieval of information based on its key.
2. The great thing about hashing is, we can achieve all three operations (search, insert and delete) in O(1) time on average.
3. Hashing is mainly used to implement a set of distinct items (only keys) and dictionaries (key value pairs).
